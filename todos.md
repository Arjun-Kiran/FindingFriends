Route some basic requests from the front end. Just do some basic echoing, ensure that autobahn is getting the request.
Figure out how to identify a user, and manage their session (or if this is even the correct paradigm with sockets).
Maybe get a game started, just build a deck in the game state manager.
Get a single user to be able to draw cards from the deck.
